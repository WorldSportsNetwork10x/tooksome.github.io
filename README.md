# Tooksome 

## Running out of Toilet Paper Makes for a ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’© Day.

Tooksome helps Office Managers and Homemakers know what's in stock,
order it, and be alerted before it runs out.

It stinks when you run out of basic supplies: you have to make a
special trip, or pay for faster shipping, or at the very least stop
what you're doing to update your shopping list.

Tooksome Home makes assembling your shopping list a breeze. It comes
with standard list of household products (and it's easy to add
more). Best of all, online ordering from Amazon is built into the app
-- no more "Subscribe and Save except not really because where am I
going to put six month's of Paper Towels".

Tooksome Office adds handy stickers that make it super simple for your
co-workers to alert you when they take supplies or notice you're
almost out of coffee filters. They just point the camera on their
phone at the sticker and hit a button -- no app needs to be
installed. Slack integration lets your coworkers add an item to
Tooksome so you don't have to stop working to add to your shopping
list.
